## Introduction
Welcome to our FullStack Course Selling Platform! This project utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) tech stack to create an interactive and user-friendly platform where educators can offer their courses in exchange for teaching others, and learners can access a wide range of courses on various topics.

Our platform empowers course providers (admins) to create engaging courses, upload video content, and manage the course materials.

To unlock the full content and receive certification upon course completion, learners can enroll in their desired courses through a straightforward payment process.
